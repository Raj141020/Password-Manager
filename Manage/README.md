# Project: Password Manager

## Description:
The Password Manager project is a Python program that allows you to securely store and manage your passwords. It provides a user-friendly interface to add, retrieve, and view passwords for various websites.

## Key Features:

1.Encryption: The project uses the cryptography library in Python to encrypt passwords, ensuring they are stored securely.

2.User Interface: The program presents a menu-based interface to interact with the password manager, making it easy to add, retrieve, and view passwords.
Data Persistence: The passwords are stored in an encrypted file, passwords.txt, ensuring they remain confidential even if the file is accessed directly.
How It Works:

3.Adding Passwords:You can add passwords by providing the website, username, and password. The password is encrypted and stored in the password manager.
If a password for a website already exists, it alerts you to prevent duplicates.
Retrieving Passwords:

You can retrieve a password by providing the website. The password manager retrieves the corresponding username and password for that website.
If the website is not found, it notifies you that no password exists.

Viewing All Passwords:
You can choose to view all stored passwords. The password manager displays a list of websites along with their corresponding usernames and passwords.
Security Considerations:

Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using the cryptography library, making them unreadable to anyone without the encryption key.
File Storage: The passwords are stored in an encrypted file, ensuring they remain confidential even if the file is accessed directly.

1.Run the program: Execute the Python script password_manager.py.

2.Menu Options: Choose to add a password, retrieve a password, or view all passwords.

3.Follow the prompts: Enter the required information as requested by the program.

4.Manage your passwords: Add, retrieve, and view passwords as needed.

Note: This project is a basic implementation for learning purposes. In a real-world scenario, additional security measures and more sophisticated storage mechanisms would be necessary.
